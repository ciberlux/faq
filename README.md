### What is Ethereum Classic?

Ethereum Classic is a secure, censorproof, reliable, public, trustless and decentralized platform for running applications.

### How is Ethereum Classic related to Ethereum?

Ethereum Classic started as a fork of the Ethereum platform after a disagreement regarding the censoring of certain transactions.  The two platforms are similar but slowly diverging.  In general the Ethereum Classic values immutability moreso that the Ethereum community.

### How is Ethereum Classic related to Bitcoin?

Bitcoin was the first blockchain application.  Ethereum Classic is a general blockchain platform to run many more types of applications than Bitcoin can.

### What is a blockchain?

A blockchain is a special type of distributed database.  The most significant attribute of blockchains is that no one controls them!  There is no one everybody needs to trust to manage it.  That is why they are referred to as trustless.  Users submit tasks in objects referred to as *transactions* that are grouped into *blocks* that are chained together to form *chains*.  This is what is referred to as the *blockchain*.

### What is a smart contract?

Smart contracts are computer systems that manage assets such as automatic teller machines and the Bitcoin system.  Ethereum Classic is able to run many types of smart contracts.  If an Ethereum Classic smart contract is not mainly a financial application, it may make more sense to emphasize their autonomy by referring to them as agents instead.

### What is ether?

Ether and ETC denote the cryptocurrency used to pay for services on the Ethereum Classic blockchain such as installing or modifying smart contracts.

### What is gas?

Gas is a made up unit used to describe the amount of resources required to do a task such as executing a smart contract.

### What is a dapp?

A dapp is a distributed application.  They are also referred to as smart contracts on the Ethereum Classic system.  The term is used to distinguish applications that run on blockchains from centralized applications.

### How do I create a dapp?

To create a dapp for Ethereum Classic you must program one in a smart contract programming language.  Then, you must compile that dapp and install it on the blockchain from an account funded with ether.

### How do I purchase ether for an account?

You can purchase ether on an exchange.  You can also mine for ether.

### What smart contract programming languages are there?

Solidity is similar to Javascript and the one with the most support.  Serpent is similar to Python and also available.  LLL is yet another choice that is similar to Lisp.  There are other smart contract languages being developed as well.

### Mining

### What is mining?

There are some computational tasks involved in adding blocks of transactions to the blockchain.  Machines on the Ethereum Classic network that voluntarily perform these tasks get a reward of ether.  For security reasons, several miners compete to complete these tasks first and win the rewards.  This effort is referred to as *mining*.

### What is proof of work information?

Mining involves doing a computational task whose only purpose is to intentionally make mining difficult!  This difficulty is required to secure the network against certain attacks.  The task involves finding a certain number related to each block.  This special number is referred to as the proof of work information for that block.

### What is a coinbase?

A coinbase is the special transaction in every block that creates new ether that is added to the account selected by the miner of that block.  It can also refer to the primary account of a user with several accounts.

### What is an uncle?

Several miners compete to be the first one to submit the next valid block to be added to the blockchain.  Inevitably some blocks submitted will be too late.  It turns out the blockchain can reference these losing blocks to make the blockchain more secure.   These losing blocks that still contribute to the security of the blockchain are referred to as *uncles*.
The term comes from the fact that every *child* block has a (preceding) *parent* block. The losing blocks that do not manage to become the parents are still related to the parents.  Hence the name uncles.
